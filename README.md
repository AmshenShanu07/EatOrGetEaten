# Zombie Sprint
`Zombie Sprint is a web-based runner game created during the React Jam 2024 event.`

You are in big trouble. A zombie infection is turning you into one of them, and it's happening fast! You can barely see straight, and your body feels like it's falling apart. There's a creepy graveyard in front of you, but that's where your only hope lies. Legend says there's a certain potion that can slow down the infection a little while, but you'll need to keep finding more or you're toast! But the catch? A creepy, hungry zombie is chasing you too. So you have to run! Dodge gravestones, hop over cracks, and grab those potions as fast as you can. Can you survive the graveyard dash and outrun the zombie menace before it's too late?
